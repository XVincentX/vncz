After 3 years (almost exactly, I joined December 14th, 2014), I have decided to leave Apiary.
I have learned and personally grown so much and I'm thankful for everyone I worked with.

But it's time for me to explore new challenges. I have many interests and I currently don't have
nor the time nor the possibility to indulge them: while I am absolutey happy to have been part of
the team that made the [Oracle acquisition]() happen, unfortunately the new roadmap as well other
internal changes clashes with my long term interests.

I'm incredibly excited and **scared** about the next step.

I will be joining [Bucmi](https://www.bucmi.com), helping the team in scaling their web applications,
making sure they're fast on mobile and desktop.

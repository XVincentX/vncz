Hello!

My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I came from Napoli (Italy) and since Dicember 2014 I've relocated in Prague, Czech Republic.
I am currently working as (front|back) developer at [Apiary](http://apiary.io) and, in particular, I lead the Documentation team, who's providing you the most used API documentation in the world. I put bugs in the code, making sure that my coworkers have always something to fix.

I am (still) tooking undergraduate degree at the Department of Engineering in Naples University. I feel ashamed because I am getting old and I do not have my title yet; Relocating in Prague did not help at all. For this reason (and a lot of other more), my father thinks I am a good-for-nothing (and perhaps he is totally right)

Historically I've always been a **.NET** developer, and still I am. However actually I am programming in **JavaScript** on daily basis.

In my working hours I spend time trying solving problems using the appropriate technologies based on the projects' requirements (failing every single time). During my spare time, I try to develop [open source software](https://github.com/XVincentX), writing articles on topics I'm interested in, working out and partying hard.

Despite that, I did not work always on a chair and with a laptop. In my career I've also worked on construction yards, where we were basically testing the control software for differend kind of machines, such as photovoltaic/wind plants.

I play the classic guitar since I was 15 years old and, like [Fernando Sor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Sor) and [Francisco Tarrega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_T%C3%A1rrega), I do not have nails on right hand. That brought me a lot of problems with my teachers while studying at National Conservatory, but I was always able to win the battle.

I own a great Bernab√© M-10, built in 2006

I love Spanish language. One time I was in Spain and I liked so much that language that decided to buy a book for babies entirely in Spanish: [El Principito](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_principito). When I felt that was enough proficient in Spanish, I started to stop persons on the street when I was able to detect that they were talking in Spanish, and asked for small conversation. Furthermore, in order to became even more fluent, I decided to move in an shared house with 1 Spanish girl, 1 Spanish Guy, a Mexican girl and a Cuban boy, that is where I actually live. On the other side, I consider my English terrible (orroroso, por ser preciso).

During July 2015 I was in Lisbon, and I liked the language so much...you may understand by yourself what's happening!

Si, descuti de aprender o idioma Portuges tambem! (but the pronunciation is a pain, and it's not going to so good to be honest, but I won't give up.)

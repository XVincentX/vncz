Hello!

My name is Vincenzo Chianese, I come from Napoli (Italy) and since Dicember 2014 I've relocated in Prague, Czech Republic.
Currently working as (front|back) developer at [Apiary](http://apiary.io). I put bugs in the code, making sure that my coworkers have always something to fix.

I am tooking undergraduate degree at the Department of Engineering in Naples University. I feel ashamed because I am getting old and I do not have my title yet; Relocating in Prague is not helping at all. My father thinks I am a good-for-nothing (and perhaps he is totally right)

Historically I've always been a .NET developer, and I am still. But actually I use javascript with nodejs on daily basis.

In my working hours I spend time trying solving problems using the appropriate technologies based on the projects' requirements. During my spare time, I try to develop [open source software](https://github.com/XVincentX), writing articles on topics I'm interested in, working out and partying hard.

I play the classic guitar since I was 15 years old, and, like [Fernando Sor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Sor) and [Francisco Tarrega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_T%C3%A1rrega), I do not have nails on right hand. That brong me a lot of problems with my teachers while studying at National Conservatory, but I was always able to win the battle.

I love Spanish language. One time I was in Spain and I liked so much that language that decided to buy a book for babies entirely in Spanish: [El Principito](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_principito). When I felt that was enough proficient in Spanish, I started to stop persons on the street when I was able to detect that they were talking in Spanish, and asked for small conversation. Furthermore, in order to became even more fluent, I decided to move in an shared house with 3 Spanish girls, that is where I actually live. On the other side, I consider my English terrible (orroroso, por ser preciso).

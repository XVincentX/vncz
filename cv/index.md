## Summary

I have done mostly (web) application development for past few years, mainly in C# and NodeJS (as it suited best for my tasks). Some of them were part of larger application I helped to design.

Given that, I moved to the front end side as well, wishing (and succeed) to become a full stack developer, focusing on what I call the backend of the frontend, and modern CSS methodologies (such as BEM). I am kind of in love with React but Angular is my lover.

My long-term interest include project management (especially of small teams), pragmatic programming, distributed software environments, collaborative editing, publishing.

## Work Experience

### [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io)
#### API Design Stack
##### Software developer - **Dec 2014 - Present**

1. Full stack software engineer (with strong attitude in FrontEnd), part of the Core Application Team, delivering features to 170k+ users.
2. Active in several open source projects
3. Crafting [Attributes Kit](http://github.com/apiaryio/attributes-kit), a [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/MSON) renderer

### Nettuno Solutions
#### Software division of Fire SPA
##### Software developer - **Sept 2013 - Dec 2014**

In charge of **Recuper@**, debt management software used by banks and similar companies
(some customers: **Deutsche Bank**, **Banca Popolare di Milano**, **Fire**, **Gextra**).

It is a _Silverlight 5_ application with a **WCF backend**, started in 2008.
However a complete rewrite has been planned and we're now replacing entire technology stack.
_NHibernate_ to **EntityFramework**, _WCF_ to **WebApi** based on Owin Middleware,
_Silverlight_ to **HTML5** (AngularJS), _Unity_ to **AutoFac**.

The application has got a mobile client too written using Xamarin framework
(iOs, Android, Wp8). Its contents are served by the same application server
using a **NodeJS** application (express framework)

The team was about 13 developers, **cloc** says we're about 330k lines of code.

### Webspaces SRL
#### Software development, Internet Service Provider and Voip Telephony
##### Cofounder - **Nov 2013 - May 2014**

In November 2013, we made sense of our hardware and technology stack was getting old.
We were not able to answer quickly and efficiently to customer requests anymore.

 For this reason, we started a modernization of all our infrastructure and software.

At first, we have completely dismantled our server farm and migrated everything to Microsoft Azure platform,
using IaaS (Asterisk PBX on CentOS). We refreshed Asterisk installation to the latest version,
and rewrote from scratch some services directly taking advantage of new Asterisk
REST API instead of old AMI interface.

A second server, with IIS and Radius service has been replaced by Azure WebSites,
Active Directory authentication, while all WebApi for phone application have been
replaced with Azure Mobile Services (some with NodeJS, some with .NET backend).

Now we have less costs, more services, less pollution, less worries...and an empty room.

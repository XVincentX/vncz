This is a serie about developing a simple Hypermedia Client in AngularJS.

1. [Hypermedia introduction](/hypermedia-client-in-angularjs/)
2. [Hypermedia formats](/hypermedia-client-in-angularjs-hypermedia-types/)
3. [Hypermedia client](/hypermedia-client-details/)
4. [Considerations](/hypermedia-client-considerations/)
5. [Hypermedia does not replace your semantic model](/hypermedia-does-not-replace-your-semantic-model/)

In this post I am going to review fundamental parts of angular js client. You may be not interested at all if you dislike [Angular](http://angularjs.org), or if you just like to read theory and not see the practise (as 90% of Hypermedia speakers).

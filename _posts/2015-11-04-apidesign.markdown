On 25-29 October I spoke at [FullStack](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6612-fullstack#program) conference, about callbacks and promises. Here is the [video link](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6774-api-blueprint-for-api-design-lifecycle)!

Unfortunately a registration is required in order to see the videos, but I really think that is worth of.

I hope you will enjoy it!

Cheers!

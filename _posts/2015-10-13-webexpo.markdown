On 24-25 September I spoke at [WebExpo](http://webexpo.net/prague2015/) conference, about callbacks and promises. Here is the video!

<script type="text/javascript" id="sle81767">
slidesLive = createSlidesLiveBox();
slidesLive.bgColor="transparent";
slidesLive.embedPresentation(38894521);
</script>

Furthermore, I'll be in London for [FullStack conference](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6612-fullstack#program), talking about better API Design with [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org).

Cheers!

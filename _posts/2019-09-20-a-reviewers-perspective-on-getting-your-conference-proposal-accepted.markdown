title: A reviewers perspective on getting your conference proposal accepted

This year I've been organising the [Barcelona instalment of APIdays](https://apidays.co/barcelona), where I’ve touched every aspect, from CFP evaluation, venue selection, catering as well as speakers' travel and accommodation.

I’ve spoken at 40 events over the last three years. I got rejected. A lot — a whole lot, and in some cases I really did not understand why. Now that I have been on the other side of the event, I have a better understanding of how a lot of things work under the hood.

## Events get a lot of proposals

APIdays Barcelona had **41** speakers from multiple countries and backgrounds. We received **184** CFPs.

We'll remove a 20% from the total number because of duplicates, people filling the form just for the sake of making me loose time and invalid data. That still keeps the number to **148**.

## Problem: it’s too time consuming to evaluate every proposal in detail

Being involved in almost everything, it turns out that my original intention of going periodically through **all** of the submissions one by one was not a viable option; it was very time consuming and I still have a full time job; therefore I had to develop a "fast framework" to decide whether a presentation was worth a serious evaluation.

I ended up checking in order:

1. Presentation Title
2. Presentation Abstract
3. A previous video of a speaking engagement

In case the video was not provided, I would then check

1. Company you're working for
2. LinkedIn profile

Failing in any of these steps would mean not being evaluated at all.

### Lesson learned: Title and Abstract are the biggest filter

No matter what great company you work for or what great previous speaking engagements/videos, GitHub profile or Open Source projects you have on the internet, these are just a byproduct for a **verification** of your persona (checking out if you can speak a reasonable English, for instance); if the title and or the abstract doesn't hit the reviewer somehow, you won't make it.

**Note:** I sometimes took the job position in consideration for a secondary selection; we'll talk about it more in the `Work with speakers` section.

## False positives and missed opportunities

Selecting a presentation is hard because all the informations you really have about it is the Title and the Abstract; sometimes you might get a recording because it has been given somewhere else; in that case, BINGO! You have almost everything you need to make a good call.

Otherwise, you're left with your own judgement.

My original intention was to get in touch with all the candidates to get a better sense of their proposal but again, it turned out that it wouldn't be a viable option.

The point is — I definitely made some bad choices where I've been mislead by the title and the abstract and genuinely thinking to bring some very good content, only to realise that effectively I was on boarding a sales pitch (or something not inherent anyway).

On the other hand, I also feel I've not selected some very interesting topics because of a non great description/title.

Finally, some of the presentations that I was kind of almost regretting accepting turned out to be really good ones.

### Lesson learned (for the reviewers)

You can't always make the right call. You're going to have failures in the speakers' selections, as well as great surprises.

### Lesson learned (for the speakers)

You might get away with with a "fake" title and a sales pitch (or also something completely different); but rest assured the reviewers **will remember you** and you won't likely be able to get away with it a second time.

Yes, I've got my own list.

## Work with the speakers

There were some presentations where I was like `Yes, but…` or also `No, but maybe…`.

In these cases, I usually felt it was a good idea to get in touch with the speaker kicking off the "secondary" screening.

The basic idea was to review who the proponent was working for as well as checking a little bit the peer's LinkedIn profile.

In case they'd be working for, let's say, Microsoft, Google, GitHub or any of these "known" companies in the space, it's likely possible that they could either point you to the right person in their organisation who had a better expertise/experience in the topic you're looking at or 
work with you on the proposal to be more in line in the topic.

The point is that for some companies there's always going to be a good story to tell, if you really look for them.

For this specific event I've been able to get very good presentations from some big companies that initially were off of the track; my proactivity to reach them out but more importantly their willingness to work with me to find a good topic was the key to get them in.

I also had the opposite experience; some other big companies didn't respond at all (even though they proposed something); some wanted to stick with their original presentation no matter what; some other said they didn't come up with anything interesting.

Ultimately, we had to reject all these proposals.

### Lesson learned

In the unlikely chance a reviewer reaches you out, it is usually a sign that they want to work with you on the content and get you in. If you were not serious about your presentation, you might want to start now.

## Not selected anyway

One thing that surprised me was the amount of proposals that were _completely not in line_ with the conference's main topic, which was (I think/hope) well specified in the CFP form as well as on the website.

I am kind of aware there are speakers that are submitting presentations in bulk _no matter what the general topic is_; I also found people submitting presentations with **APIs** and other buzzwords in the CFPs (see point n.1), but the meat was still not in line with the topic. They tried it, I guess.

Some of these presentations, though, were **really** good. They were just not a good ones for this specific event.

### Lesson learned

No matter how good your presentation is — if it is not in line with the conference topic you can put whatever buzzword you want, but you won't make it. And if you do for some reason, you're going to be marked as a `False Positive` (see the relative section above)

Which we can rephrase as a corollary:

**Please take time to read what the conference/event is about.**

## Sponsors

This is kind of a delicate topic. Sponsors are an important for every event. They make the conference possible and help to keep the tickets prices reasonable; but they will likely expect something back from you, and usually a speaking slot is among these perks.

Some of the proposed talks might be good; in that case — **BINGO!**, go get a beer.

I also had a sponsors saying to me that being a sponsor didn't really change anything for them and they wanted to go through the "regular" process in any case. I've really appreciated that.

Unfortunately, chances are that the proposed presentation is something not in line with the conference. Worst case, you might get a sales pitch.

In certain cases you might be able to work with the sponsors' speaker and get them back on the right track and deliver something valuable for the audience. Sometimes they won't change their idea and either:

1. Reword the title and the abstract to be better, but still delivering the same sales pitch/topic not in line
2. Get a "NO" response as "This is what I have, and this is what I will deliver"

### Lesson learned (for the reviewers)

There's nothing really you can do about this. You're going to get criticised anyway for that. The audience will usually not understand the situation and will send you emails about that.

### Lesson learned (for the sponsors)

You might be in a position to force your content; be aware that both the audience and likely the reviewers/organizers will not really like you.

## Timing is important

Since the inception of the conference (10 months ago), I had a clear idea of what the event should all be about. I had 4 main tracks in mind:

* Stories from the transportation industry
* APIs for B2B Applications
* APIs for B2C Applications
* APIs in Public Sector

As the time passes in and the CFPs are coming and coming, you will periodically review them and start sending the notifications to your speakers, slowly filling the slots.

At a certain point, I realised that while I had some of the tracks pretty well covered, other ones were almost empty. For this reason, I had to change the strategy and give priority to empty tracks during the selection.

Although the review process was almost the same, presentations in topic but not in the track that I wanted to fill were put on hold. Some of them were ultimately not selected even though their content was very good.

### Lesson learned

Submit your proposal as soon as possible. The more empty spaces there are, more are the chances you're going to get selected.

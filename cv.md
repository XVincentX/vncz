## Summary

I have done mostly (web) application development for past few years, mainly in C# and NodeJS (as it suited best for my tasks). Some of them were part of larger application I helped to design.

Given that, I decided to move to the front end dark side as well, wishing (and succeeding) to become a full stack developer, focusing on what I call the backend of the frontend, and modern CSS methodologies.

My long-term interest include project management (especially of small teams), pragmatic programming, distributed software environments, collaborative editing, publishing.

## Work Experience

### [Apiary.io](http://apiary.io)
#### API Design Stack as Service
##### Software developer - **Oct 2014 - Jul 2017**

I've been working as a full stack software engineer (with strong attitude in Frontend), Team Leader for Documentation Team, delivering features to 200k+ users.

Initially I've been involved in multiple parts of the application (**payment infrastructure**, **team
management**, as well part of the team that crafted the first **microservice**) - then my focus has been
entirely on the generated **Documentation pages**.

During the journey, I had my chances to contribute multiple times back in severarl open source projects,
as well as create totally new ones for our purposes. One example would be the
[Attributes Kit](https://github.com/apiaryio/attributes-kit).

While most of the code was **CoffeScript**, we slowly moved to **ES6** for all new libraries.
While most of frontend code is still a **Backbone** application, we're slowly moving to React.

### [Nettuno Solutions](http://www.nettunosolutions.com)
#### Software division of Fire SPA
##### Software developer - **Sept 2013 - Dec 2014**

In charge of **Recuper@**, debt management software used by banks and similar companies
(some customers: **Deutsche Bank**, **Banca Popolare di Milano**, **Fire**, **Gextra**).

It is a _Silverlight 5_ application with a **WCF backend**, started in 2008.

I've been involved in the application mantainance as well as introducing new features.

In particular, I was part of the small team planning a major technological update as migrating
_NHibernate_ to **EntityFramework**, _WCF_ to **WebApi** based on Owin Middleware,
_Silverlight_ to **HTML**, _Unity_ to **AutoFac**.

The team was about 13 developers, **cloc** says we're about 330k lines of code.

### [Webspaces SRL](http://www.webspaces.it)
#### Software development, Internet Service Provider and Voip Telephony
##### Cofounder - **Nov 2013 - May 2014**

In November 2013, we made sense of our hardware and technology stack was getting old.
We were not able to answer quickly and efficiently to customer requests anymore.

For this reason, we started a modernization of all our infrastructure and software.

At first, we have completely dismantled our server farm and migrated everything to **Microsoft Azure**
platform, using IaaS (Asterisk PBX on CentOS). We refreshed **Asterisk** installation to the latest version,
and rewrote from scratch some services directly taking advantage of new Asterisk REST API instead of
old **AMI interface**.

A second server, with **IIS and Radius** service has been replaced by **Azure WebSites**,
Active Directory authentication, while all WebApi for phone application have been
replaced with Azure Mobile Services (some with NodeJS, some with .NET backend).

Now we have less costs, more services, less pollution, less worries...and an empty room.
